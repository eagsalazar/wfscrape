### WF Scrape

I really wanted to know what my balances were without going to WF website.

Ultimately I'd like to make a gem that can be used to build apps that can do everything
you can normally do via the WF website:

* check balances
* see transaction history
* do transfers
* make payments
* etc

In addition it would be cool to add things like:

* Low balance notifications
* Budget overspending notifications
* ??

There are lots of cool potential apps, for example:

* A little Android desktop widget app that shows my current balance.
* A complete replacement for WF that doesn't completely suck


Having said all that, most likely, there will never be another commit to this repo :)
